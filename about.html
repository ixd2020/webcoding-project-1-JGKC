          <b>Andy Wahol</b>
          was an American artist, film director, and producer who was a leading
          figure in the visual art movement which is alsoknown as pop art. His
          works explore the relationship between artistic expression,
          advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and
          span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening,
          photography, film, and sculpture.

              <b>1970s</b><br />
              Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s,
              the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more
              entrepreneurial. According to Bob Colacello, Warhol devoted much
              of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait
              commissions. Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader
              Mao Zedong was created in 1973. He also founded, with Gerard
              Malanga, Interview magazine, and published The Philosophy of Andy
              Warhol (1975). An idea expressed in the book: "Making money is
              art, and working is art and good business is the best art." Warhol
              socialized at various nightspots in New York City, including Max's
              Kansas City and, later in the 1970s, Studio 54. He was generally
              regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer. Art critic
              Robert Hughes called him "the white mole of Union Square." In
              1979, along with his longtime friend Stuart Pivar, Warhol founded
              the New York Academy of Art.

              <b>Pop Art</b>
              <br /><br />
              By the beginning of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form
              that several artists were independently adopting; some of these
              pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous
              with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the "Pope of
              Pop", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be
              part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images
              taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint
              drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done
              and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of
              successful abstract expressionists (such as Willem de Kooning).
              Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961,
              serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit
              Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art
              contemporaries Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Robert
              Rauschenberg had also once graced.
