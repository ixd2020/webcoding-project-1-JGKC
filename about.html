          <b>Andy Wahol</b>
          was an American artist, film director, and producer who was a leading
          figure in the visual art movement which is alsoknown as pop art. His
          works explore the relationship between artistic expression,
          advertising, and celebrity culture that flourished by the 1960s, and
          span a variety of media, including painting, silkscreening,
          photography, film, and sculpture.

              <b style="font-size:20px">Early life</b><br />
              Warhol was born on August 6, 1928, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He
              was the fourth child of Ondrej Warhola (Americanized as Andrew
              Warhola, Sr., 1889–1942) and Julia (née Zavacká, 1892–1972), whose
              first child was born in their homeland of Austria-Hungary and died
              before their move to the U.S. <br /><br />
              His parents were working-class Lemko emigrants from Mikó,
              Austria-Hungary (now called Miková, located in today's
              northeastern Slovakia). Warhol's father emigrated to the United
              States in 1914, and his mother joined him in 1921, after the death
              of Warhol's grandparents. Warhol's father worked in a coal mine.
              The family lived at 55 Beelen Street and later at 3252 Dawson
              Street in the Oakland neighborhood of Pittsburgh.nThe family was
              Ruthenian Catholic and attended St. John Chrysostom Byzantine
              Catholic Church. Andy Warhol had two elder brothers—Pavol (Paul),
              the eldest, was born before the family emigrated; Ján was born in
              Pittsburgh. Pavol's son, James Warhola, became a successful
              children's book illustrator.<br /><br />
              In third grade, Warhol had Sydenham's chorea (also known as St.
              Vitus' Dance), the nervous system disease that causes involuntary
              movements of the extremities, which is believed to be a
              complication of scarlet fever which causes skin pigmentation
              blotchiness. At times when he was confined to bed, he drew,
              listened to the radio and collected pictures of movie stars around
              his bed. Warhol later described this period as very important in
              the development of his personality, skill-set and preferences.
              When Warhol was 13, his father died in an accident. <br /><br />
              As a teenager, Warhol graduated from Schenley High School in 1945.
              Also as a teen, Warhol won a Scholastic Art and Writing Award.
              After graduating from high school, his intentions were to study
              art education at the University of Pittsburgh in the hope of
              becoming an art teacher, but his plans changed and he enrolled in
              the Carnegie Institute of Technology, now Carnegie Mellon
              University in Pittsburgh, where he studied commercial art. During
              his time there, Warhol joined the campus Modern Dance Club and
              Beaux Arts Society. He also served as art director of the student
              art magazine, Cano, illustrating a cover in 1948 and a full-page
              interior illustration in 1949. These are believed to be his first
              two published artworks. Warhol earned a Bachelor of Fine Arts in
              pictorial design in 1949. Later that year, he moved to New York
              City and began a career in magazine illustration and advertising.

              <br /><br /><b style="font-size:20px">1950s</b><br />
              Warhol's early career was dedicated to commercial and advertising
              art, where his first commission had been to draw shoes for Glamour
              magazine in the late 1940s. In the 1950s, Warhol worked as a
              designer for shoe manufacturer Israel Miller.<br /><br />

              Warhol was an early adopter of the silk screen printmaking process
              as a technique for making paintings. A young Warhol was taught
              silk screen printmaking techniques by Max Arthur Cohn at his
              graphic arts business in Manhattan. While working in the shoe
              industry, Warhol developed his "blotted line" technique, applying
              ink to paper and then blotting the ink while still wet, which was
              akin to a printmaking process on the most rudimentary scale. His
              use of tracing paper and ink allowed him to repeat the basic image
              and also to create endless variations on the theme, a method that
              prefigures his 1960s silk-screen canvas.

              <br /><br /><b style="font-size:20px">1960s</b><br />
              Warhol began exhibiting his work during the 1950s. He held
              exhibitions at the Hugo Gallery and the Bodley Gallery in New York
              City; in California, his first West Coast gallery exhibition was
              on July 9, 1962, in the Ferus Gallery of Los Angeles with
              Campbell's Soup Cans. The exhibition marked his West Coast debut
              of pop art. Andy Warhol's first New York solo pop art exhibition
              was hosted at Eleanor Ward's Stable Gallery November 6–24, 1962.
              The exhibit included the works Marilyn Diptych, 100 Soup Cans, 100
              Coke Bottles, and 100 Dollar Bills. At the Stable Gallery exhibit,
              the artist met for the first time poet John Giorno who would star
              in Warhol's first film, Sleep, in 1963.<br /><br />

              It was during the 1960s that Warhol began to make paintings of
              iconic American objects such as dollar bills, mushroom clouds,
              electric chairs, Campbell's Soup Cans, Coca-Cola bottles,
              celebrities such as Marilyn Monroe, Elvis Presley, and Elizabeth
              Taylor, as well as newspaper headlines or photographs of police
              dogs attacking African-American protesters during the Birmingham
              campaign in the civil rights movement. During these years, he
              founded his studio, "The Factory" and gathered about him a wide
              range of artists, writers, musicians, and underground celebrities.

              <br /><br /><b style="font-size:20px">1970s</b><br />
              Compared to the success and scandal of Warhol's work in the 1960s,
              the 1970s were a much quieter decade, as he became more
              entrepreneurial. According to Bob Colacello, Warhol devoted much
              of his time to rounding up new, rich patrons for portrait
              commissions. Warhol's famous portrait of Chinese Communist leader
              Mao Zedong was created in 1973. He also founded, with Gerard
              Malanga, Interview magazine, and published The Philosophy of Andy
              Warhol (1975). An idea expressed in the book: "Making money is
              art, and working is art and good business is the best art." Warhol
              socialized at various nightspots in New York City, including Max's
              Kansas City and, later in the 1970s, Studio 54. He was generally
              regarded as quiet, shy, and a meticulous observer. Art critic
              Robert Hughes called him "the white mole of Union Square." In
              1979, along with his longtime friend Stuart Pivar, Warhol founded
              the New York Academy of Art.

              <br /><br /><b style="font-size:20px">1980s</b><br />
              Warhol had a re-emergence of critical and financial success in the
              1980s, partially due to his affiliation and friendships with a
              number of prolific younger artists, who were dominating the "bull
              market" of 1980s New York art, as well as members of the
              Transavantgarde movement in Europe. Before the 1984 Sarajevo
              Winter Olympics, he teamed with 15 other artists and contributed a
              Speed Skater print to the Art and Sport collection. The Speed
              Skater was used for the official Sarajevo Winter Olympics
              poster.<br /><br />

              By this time, graffiti artist Fab Five Freddy paid homage to
              Warhol when he painted an entire train with Campbell soup cans.
              This was instrumental in Freddy becoming involved in the
              underground NYC art scene and becoming an affiliate of
              Basquiat.<br /><br />

              By this period, Warhol was being criticized for becoming merely a
              "business artist". In 1979, reviewers disliked his exhibits of
              portraits of 1970s personalities and celebrities, calling them
              superficial, facile and commercial, with no depth or indication of
              the significance of the subjects. They also criticized his 1980
              exhibit of 10 portraits at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan,
              entitled Jewish Geniuses, which Warhol—who was uninterested in
              Judaism and Jews—had described in his diary as "They're going to
              sell." In hindsight, however, some critics have come to view
              Warhol's superficiality and commerciality as "the most brilliant
              mirror of our times," contending that "Warhol had captured
              something irresistible about the zeitgeist of American culture in
              the 1970s."

              <br /><br /><b style="font-size:20px">Death</b><br />
              Warhol died in Manhattan at 6:32 a.m. on February 22, 1987, at age
              58. According to news reports, he had been making a good recovery
              from gallbladder surgery at New York Hospital before dying in his
              sleep from a sudden post-operative irregular heartbeat. Prior to
              his diagnosis and operation, Warhol delayed having his recurring
              gallbladder problems checked, as he was afraid to enter hospitals
              and see doctors. His family sued the hospital for inadequate care,
              saying that the arrhythmia was caused by improper care and water
              intoxication. The malpractice case was quickly settled out of
              court; Warhol's family received an undisclosed sum of money.<br /><br />

              Shortly before Warhol's death, doctors expected Warhol to survive
              the surgery, though a re-evaluation of the case about thirty years
              after his death showed many indications that Warhol's surgery was
              in fact riskier than originally thought. It was widely reported at
              the time that Warhol died of a "routine" surgery, though when
              considering factors such as his age, a family history of
              gallbladder problems, his previous gunshot wound, and his medical
              state in the weeks leading up to the procedure, the potential risk
              of death following the surgery appeared to have been significant.

              <b style="font-size:20px">Pop Art</b>
              <br /><br />
              By the beginning of the 1960s, pop art was an experimental form
              that several artists were independently adopting; some of these
              pioneers, such as Roy Lichtenstein, would later become synonymous
              with the movement. Warhol, who would become famous as the "Pope of
              Pop", turned to this new style, where popular subjects could be
              part of the artist's palette. His early paintings show images
              taken from cartoons and advertisements, hand-painted with paint
              drips. Marilyn Monroe was a pop art painting that Warhol had done
              and it was very popular. Those drips emulated the style of
              successful abstract expressionists (such as Willem de Kooning).
              Warhol's first pop art paintings were displayed in April 1961,
              serving as the backdrop for New York Department Store Bonwit
              Teller's window display. This was the same stage his Pop Art
              contemporaries Jasper Johns, James Rosenquist and Robert
              Rauschenberg had also once graced.
